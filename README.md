It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:

A block of code is set as follows:
public void StartGame()
{
// NOTE: You should put in the name of the Scene
// that respresents your level 1
SceneManager.LoadScene("CH1_Awakening");
}
```

Chapter 1 provides a good background of what a role-playing game is.
